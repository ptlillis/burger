# Burger

This is an application that allows the user to 'eat' existing burger recipes, input their own burger recipes, and choose to eat them after creating. This application utilizes both front and back end, allowing the user to send information from the front end browser (client) to the back end tables, and bring the information back to the front end using JS and CSS targeting, as well as handlebars rendering. This is a one page application. Styling is pretty bare, just looking for functionality for now. The functional app has been deployed to heroku.

## Installation

Installation is not required to run this application. Please visit (https://floating-thicket-52759.herokuapp.com/) to use the deployed app. If you wish to install on your local server, clone the repo here. Navigate to the appropriate folders, run NPM I (adding all necessary dependencies, including express, express handlebars, and mysql) create the database connection in your Workbench, and then run node server.js in the command line. You will be directed to view the app on your browser using localhost.

## Usage

On the deployed site, the user can select from pre-seeded burgers to eat, or add a new burger, which will send that new field to the available burgers section above. This application utilizes both the front and back end functionality uploaded to Heroku.

## Contributing
Part of this code was built using references from classwork, particularly the cats_db example.

## Issues

Functionality is there, most of the issues pertain to styling. With more time, I will be able to clean styling and ensure a proper UI workflow. Additionally, I will be able to finalize the DELETE route.
